# 📡 Mobility Changes Traditional Security Approaches - Notes

## 🔐 1. Lack of Physical Security
- In traditional wired networks, access control relied on **physical presence** inside the building.
- With wireless networks, attackers can attempt to access the network **remotely** from nearby locations.
- Tools and techniques now allow attackers to compromise wireless networks **without physical entry**.

## 🧩 2. Accidental Associations (Unauthorized Networks)
- Users may **accidentally connect** to networks that are not approved by administrators.
- Example: A user connects to a **neighbor's Wi-Fi** or a **rogue network** set up by an attacker.
- These connections can lead to **data theft** or **system compromise**.

## 🔁 3. New Security Paradigm
- Traditionally, admins protect the network **from unauthorized users**.
- In wireless environments, admins must also protect **users from untrusted networks**.
- This adds **double complexity** to network and client security.

## 📱 4. Consumerization of IT
- Users bring **personal devices** (phones, tablets, etc.) into corporate environments.
- These devices demand **wireless access**, which increases security challenges.
- The desire for **mobility** complicates traditional security models.

## 📶 5. Wireless ≠ Just Wi-Fi
- Many think wireless security is only about Wi-Fi, but it includes various technologies:
  - **Bluetooth / BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**
  - **Zigbee / Z-Wave**
  - **RFID / NFC (smart cards, contactless systems)**
  - **DECT (cordless phone systems)**
- Most organizations lack the **skills and experience** to properly assess and secure all of these.
- These technologies can be **as vulnerable as open Wi-Fi** if not properly secured.
